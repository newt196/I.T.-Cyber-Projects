**General Writeups**

Info for common malware, techniques and factors to avoid when implementing security solutions. 


Any.run local environment project writeup.

This will be a report of malware I find through rep, youtube, reddit and Cyberdefenders. 

The Goal:

I wanted to have my own any.run local lab for better viewing and better control on malware launched within the environment.



Risk and how to avoid them as a student

First instance was virtualized and proper precautions were not taken
- Malware was easy to monitor but often detected the virtualized environment.
- If launch, had a brief scare of the spare computer acting weird after launching a trojan. 

A computer that is put into a faraday cage. 
- I have a second internet connection through a spare sim. So the computer can "reach out" outside of my network.
- No devices are connected and no second machine monitoring the device.
- All memory is isolated to only itself
- treating all connected devices as infected(mostly usb or plug in memory)

Monitor, monitor, monitor
- Because Wireshark and a second computer is not used here. I needed to use a way to monitor the following like any.run.
This includes:
- memory(ram,ssd, local cache)
- Changes
- Network ingress and egress

Some issues to resolve onsite and installations to combat a single machine instance

Windows instance
- Yara rules
- Backups(offsite)
- Procman
- Regshot - also important 
- Volatility
- Most important - Sysmon



When proceeding with other malware examples we need to first run through the following

- Mitre Attacke
(most important point is Defense/Evasion...for right now)
some malware has better protections than others. Often writeups or analysis 

- Any.run on that strand(look for different instances of the strand to launch) 
Note SteelC an the different mutations 

(C and C++) IDA & Radare2
breakdown obfuscation techniques within strand or provided example


Some side notes. 
It was earlier mentioned that we cannot use a virtual environment based on defense Evasion used within malware today.

Things to consider
- If extensive research has been done on the reverse engineering of the strand, we may be able to disable 
the measures to not launch within a virtual environment. 

- This is also no share to Any.Run
I think anyrun is very powerful tool for a quick overview and rundown on machine and malware interactions
....but. The 300 dollar price tag for 300 dollars is not worth it IMO.
