Task 1 is a joke.

Apache server as earlier stated. 
Looking at the site loads what looks to be a script to run a linux login. Not prompted to a terminal login as root on fsociety. Gives me the option to run 6 or 7 commands. 
Running prepare: weird video. 
Running fsociety: shorter video. 
Running inform: more hints and such. 
Have promise with the join command…join returns a script sending of dialogue. Now asking for an email address. Plugged an email address test@gmail.com returned “see you soon”. 
Plugged in a ral email address to see if itr would send a hint or the next steps. 
Found in robots.txt User-agent: *
fsocity.dic
key-1-of-3.txt

Tried to curl the output of the first file, but unable to to do so. 
Found some commands trying curl -- http://10.10.184.106/robots.txt --output *   which downloads the file, but not the contents. 

Going back, viewing the page source of the web address returns.

In green is interesting
http://browsehappy.com/
visiting the site doesn’t really help either. 
I also see 208.185.115.6


Not any ip I recognize, site says it’s the User_IP. 
Returns a invalid ip. 
There is <script src="js/s_code.js"></script>
    <script src="js/main-acba06a5.js"></script>
Returns a whole lot of information to parse through. Just seems like scripts to run the website. Nothing stands out that is obvious. Also still no email. 
I was overthinking the curling the webpage, we can just type in the txt into the url lie so. http://10.10.184.106/key-1-of-3.txt

You get 073403c8a58a1f80d943455fb30724b9


2.2 What is key 2?
Visiting 10.10.184.106/User-agent: * returns nothing. 
Visiting http://10.10.184.106/fsocity.dic downloaded soemthing to my system. 
Returned a file called fsooity.dir.
Contains something I have never seen. Words are hidden until you hover or select them.
Seems like a basic wod list, maybe for bruteforcing ssh? List is rally long. 
So we have user-agent: *

Fsocity.dic: wordlist.
Funny how society is mispeled.  
Tried to connect to ssh beut connection refuses. 
Going back to the webpage source, searched key words that could help like “ssh”, “login” and “user” in the jscript.
Something to note is that I found a 
                    content: "-!- friend_ [friend_@" + USER_IP + "] has joined #fsociety.",

root@fsociety:
trying root@fsociety now..nothing new. 

I think its friend@10.10.184.106 in looking more into the jscript. 
Invalid email. 
friend_ [friend_@" + USER_IP + "] has joined #fsociety.",
this expriession I think is kept hidden or I am tripping. 
Friend_@ + 10.10.184.106, im stupid its my ip. 
Going to gobuster wat I amissing. Missing what the domain name is. 
Returned a decent amount of results. 
Something funny is that /atom crashedmy browser.

Got a login @ http://10.10.184.106/wp-login.php.
Wordpress login which is out of the ordinary. 
Used Hydra to brute force the username with the commands /home/kali/thm/rooms/mrrobot/loot# hydra -L fsocity.dic -p test 10.10.12.13 
Found Elliot as the username 
Returned a ER28-0652, elliots employee number. 

Needed a guide for the rest of this, but how I can explain is that we need a reverse shell for reverses shell in wordpress.

What is key 3?
Hint nmap
Strange hint, but I remember seeing info about hwo to escualte privlerage by setting up a shell that escualtes prvileages in a usr folder. Looking around manually in the usr/ folders I see 
/usr/bin/sudo & /usr/local/bin/nmap 
The latter may be a clue 
Sudo doesn’t really return anything, looking at gtfo bins we can see there is a shell for the nmap binary.
https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/nmap/

Plugging in. 

aemon@linux:/$ /usr/local/bin/nmap --interactive
/usr/local/bin/nmap –interactive
