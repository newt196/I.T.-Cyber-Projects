Hello :)

I hope you are fidnding this page because you are curious on what is happening with my projects after work.
This page helps to outline and document data, figures and technical jargon for projects that I have been working on after 5.

Both in I.T. and Cybersecurity

Projects are typically of the following.
Done and completed. Either they have been done 6-12 months ago, but documents have not been sent to github (Most ctf's and serer updates writeups)
Done but eith no documents made (Most server hardening updates and a few ctf's)
Ongoing with documents (More advanced projects that are based around red and blue teaming. Documents are half made with pending writeups)
