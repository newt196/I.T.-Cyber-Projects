Main Windows Computer
Hosts - Kali linux instance - Hypervisor 2
Main computer that hosts my only instance of kali linux through Virtual box.
The networking works as suck
Windows computer is using lan | Kali linux is using WLAN that support monitor mode

Main Windows Server  
Hosts | Ubuntu 22 - Hypervisor 2  | Windows Server 2022 | 
Open on SSH...for now. Verified with nmap 
SSH is configuired to open manually
Security is lackluster at default. Will not work on the same micosoft account(https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/ssh-into-microsoft-linked-windows-account/67cb53aa-22c3-4dc8-914a-1030efa1fd81)
Wild, but will work...work to well on a computer that is setup outside of the account. Working as in will grant access upon three tries of the password being "wrong"
The password is coprrect, but from what I can guess is the pki not being configured and not routing the correct password to the host properly.
SSH needs: PKI infra | Port forwading
SSH importace: Important to access server recourses from outside of the newtork securely. Just need to truple check that the access is secured and checked and peer reviewed. 

Main server needs:

automated nmap scans and checks.

Network diagram
Prox mox more to come on thayt later

IDS solution (snort most likely)
A way to montior and send logs securely

Segementation for Windows server/computer | WIndows and Ubuntu laptops
No reason other than learning
Right now on a default 192/24 config


SNMP module for montiring ther server remotely.

SSH tarpit to slow or montiro brute force attempts

HTTP & HTTPS host for misc request
Python code, exploits, and basic sites
More to come on that

Email domain? Unsure how the hosting works onm a network level and outside of Dovecot.


CLoud solutions in the future...but we will see.
