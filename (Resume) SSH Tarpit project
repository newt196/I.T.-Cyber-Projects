Background: Implmented a layered approach to my ubuntu serevr hosting my SSH server. More specifically on port 22. Because 

port forwaded ip/public ip  = 192.168.54.***

Honeytrap/Tarpit port = 22
Moved SSH port = 4224

Most attempts on port 22 or the server was bot activity. (Almost all activity)

Most users or bots trying to bruteforce the login was met with a 
Implmented fail2ban to automatically clear out any bots or systems that was still trying to login and re trying the login attempt. 
Most attempts would time out and be banned after 5-10 minutes. 
Interesting to note that being open for a month or so, most system that hit the server were automated attacks. 
Typically the system giving up after being met with the inital tarpit. Once the system re tries the server login.

Interesting to note that of the few systemms that would try to login:
Some would try to login after over some time  until being banned

One instance where logins were tried port 22 from one ip, getting banned. More intesnive system scan coming in from a differetn but similar ip. 
The attacker figfureing now trying port 4224, without successfull login.
