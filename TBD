Setup and monitored an Endlessh a honeypot/tarpit 
Two SSH servers setup fopr ligitimate use on port 3333, while Endlessh was opened on the stanbdard ssh port.
Attackers and Bots once met with port 22 login, are caught in 
Illegitmtte login attempts are logged and blocked for later, while all other legigitmate logins are logged elsewhere.
Mostly was able to monitor bots and basic script kiddies, hardening my SSH enviroment.
