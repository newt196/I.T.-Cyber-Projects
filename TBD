Setup and monitored an Endlessh a honeypot/tarpit 
Two SSH servers setup fopr ligitimate use on port 3333, while Endlessh was opened on the stanbdard ssh port.
Attackers and Bots once met with port 22 login, are caught in 
Illegitmtte login attempts are logged and blocked for later, while all other legigitmate logins are logged elsewhere.
Mostly was able to monitor bots and basic script kiddies, hardening my SSH enviroment. 


Configured two SSH servers for legitimate access on port 3333, while deploying Endlessh as a honeypot on the standard SSH port (22) to trap attackers.
Captured and analyzed unauthorized login attempts on port 22, logging and blocking illegitimate access attempts for further review.
Implemented a dual logging system to separate legitimate login activity from malicious attempts, enhancing overall security and monitoring capabilities.
Successfully monitored and identified bot and script kiddie activity, significantly hardening the SSH environment against common and script based attacks.

Setup monitoring on all interent facing servers and computers.
Installed Wazuh on a dedicated VM on my Windows server to get familiar with monitring and detection. 
Setup user agents in my Unix enviroment, Windows server enviroment personal computer and laptop.


Deployed and configured Wazuh for real-time security monitoring across multiple endpoints, enhancing threat detection and incident response capabilities.

Integrated Wazuh with Elasticsearch and Kibana to create custom dashboards for visualizing security events, resulting in improved situational awareness and actionable insights.

Developed and fine-tuned detection rules within Wazuh to minimize false positives and accurately identify threats such as unauthorized access, malware, and file integrity violations.

Implemented an automated incident response framework using Wazuh, reducing response times and effectively containing potential security breaches.

Conducted comprehensive log analysis and forensic investigations using Wazuh, leading to the identification and mitigation of network vulnerabilities and attack vectors.
